# PythonIPban
This is my Diploma project code in Python. The idea came from my mentor professor Kyriakos Vlachos. Its a python program with ui that takes the log file from a mikrotik router "or other", the most relevant txt with malware ips, compares the two of them and then passing bans for the bad ips that you already have visited once.
